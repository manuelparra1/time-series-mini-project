# Time Series Project

> ### Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data

## Project Description

For this project I will be using historical temperature data acquired from Kaggle.com
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data
I will use this data to conduct time series analysis and utilize predictions models to predict temperatures of a validate and test dataset.
I will compare my results and use my findings to forecast future temperature data.

## Project Goals

    - Analyse temperature data for patterns to better utilize time series techniques
    - Forecast future data

## Initial Questions

    - What is the date range of the temperature data?
    - What regions are measured?
    - What subset will I use?

## The Plan

### 1. Acquire data

    - Data aquired from Kaggle

### 2. Prepare

    - Renamed colums to read pythonic
    - Filled nulls using interpolation
    - Checked that column data types were appropriate and had to change as necessary
    - Split data into train, validate and test using human based logic.

### 3. Explore data and answer questions:

    - What is the date range of the temperature data?
    - What regions are measured?
    - What subset will I use?

## Steps to Reproduce

    1. Clone this repo.
    2. Acquire the data from Kaggle
    3. Put the data in the file containing the cloned repo.
    4. Run notebook.

## Takeaways and Conclusions

    - The planet is not burning up.
    - The future brings tepid temperatures.

## Recommendations

    - Still continue to recycle
    - Push "Green" standars
